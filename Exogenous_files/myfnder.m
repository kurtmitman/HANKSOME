function dpp = myfnder(pp)
%MYFNDER returns dpp, the fist derivative of the piecewise polynomial form
% pp, which is a piecewise polynomial of one order less than pp in general
% ( same as fnder(pp,1)=fnder(pp) in Matlab's spline fitting toolbox)

if (pp.order == 1)
    
    dcoefs = zeros(size(pp.coefs));
    
elseif (pp.order > 1)

    dorder = pp.order-1;
    expo = repmat(fliplr(1:dorder),[pp.pieces 1]);
    dcoefs = pp.coefs(:,1:dorder).*expo;
